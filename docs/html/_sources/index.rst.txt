llm_github_actions
=====================

Welcome to llm_github_actions, a comprehensive Python project that showcases various aspects of programming, including object-oriented programming, arithmetic operations, and string manipulation.

Project Description
-----------------

llm_github_actions is a collection of Python scripts that demonstrate different programming concepts and techniques. The project consists of four main modules, each focusing on a specific area of programming. The modules are designed to be self-contained, making it easy to understand and use them individually or together.

The first module focuses on object-oriented programming, defining classes for bank accounts, including `BankAccount`, `CheckingAccount`, and `SavingsAccount`. The second module provides a simple calculator function that performs basic arithmetic operations. The third module defines a single function `double` that takes an integer as input and returns its double. The fourth module consists of a function `add_string_to_name` that appends a suffix to a given string.

Installation
------------

To install llm_github_actions, simply clone the repository and install the required dependencies using pip:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install -r requirements.txt

Modules
-------

### Bank Account Module

The bank account module defines three classes: `BankAccount`, `CheckingAccount`, and `SavingsAccount`. These classes represent different types of bank accounts and provide methods for depositing and withdrawing money, as well as getting the current balance.

### Calculator Module

The calculator module defines four arithmetic functions: `add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, and `divide`. These functions take two float numbers as input and perform the respective arithmetic operation.

### Double Module

The double module defines a single function `double` that takes an integer as input and returns its double.

### String Manipulation Module

The string manipulation module defines a single function `add_string_to_name` that takes a string as input and returns a new string with a specified suffix appended to the end.

Usage
-----

To use llm_github_actions, simply import the desired module and call the relevant functions or methods. For example:

.. code-block:: python

   from bank_account import CheckingAccount
   account = CheckingAccount(1234, 1000.0)
   account.deposit(500.0)
   print(account.get_balance())
