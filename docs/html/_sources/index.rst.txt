**Project Title**
================

Python Project

**Project Description**
=====================

This Python project is a collection of scripts that demonstrate various concepts and techniques in Python programming. The project consists of four scripts, each with its own unique functionality.

The first script defines three classes: `BankAccount`, `CheckingAccount`, and `SavingsAccount`, which represent different types of bank accounts. The classes have methods for depositing and withdrawing money, deducting fees, and adding interest.

The second script defines four arithmetic functions: `add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, and `divide`, which perform basic arithmetic operations. The script also defines a `calculator` function that displays a menu for the user to choose an arithmetic operation.

The third script defines a simple function `double` that takes an integer as input and returns its double.

The fourth script defines a function `add_string_to_name` that takes a string as input and returns a new string with '_name' appended to the end.

**Installation Instructions**
=============================

To install this project, simply clone the repository and run the scripts using Python. There are no additional dependencies required.

**Directory Structure**
=====================

The project directory structure is as follows:

* `script1.py`: defines the bank account classes
* `script2.py`: defines the arithmetic functions and calculator
* `script3.py`: defines the `double` function
* `script4.py`: defines the `add_string_to_name` function

**File Descriptions**
=====================
