llm_github_actions
=====================

The llm_github_actions project is a collection of Python scripts that demonstrate various concepts and functionalities. The project consists of five modules, each with its own unique features and purposes.

The main goal of this project is to provide a comprehensive understanding of object-oriented programming, arithmetic operations, and string manipulation in Python.

Installation
------------

To install the project, simply clone the repository and navigate to the project directory. The project has no dependencies, and all necessary modules are included.

Modules
-------

### Bank Account Module

The Bank Account module consists of three classes: `BankAccount`, `CheckingAccount`, and `SavingsAccount`. The `BankAccount` class is the base class that represents a general bank account, while the `CheckingAccount` and `SavingsAccount` classes are subclasses that represent specific types of bank accounts.

### Arithmetic Operations Module

The Arithmetic Operations module defines four functions: `add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, and `divide`. These functions take two float numbers as input and perform the respective arithmetic operation.

### Double Module

The Double module defines a single function called `double`, which takes an integer as input and returns its double.

### String Manipulation Module

The String Manipulation module defines a single function called `add_string_to_name`, which takes a string as input and returns a new string with '_name' appended to the end.

Usage
-----

To use the project, simply run the individual scripts or import the modules into your own Python project. Each module has its own unique functionality, and the usage is demonstrated in the respective script.
