llm_github_actions
=====================

Description
-----------

The llm_github_actions project is a collection of Python scripts that demonstrate various programming concepts and principles. The project consists of four modules, each showcasing a different aspect of Python programming.

The first module demonstrates object-oriented programming principles, including inheritance and polymorphism, to model different types of bank accounts and their behaviors. The second module provides a simple calculator program that performs basic arithmetic operations. The third module defines a simple function to double an integer input. The fourth module demonstrates a function to add a suffix to a string.

Installation
------------

To install the project, simply clone the repository and install the required dependencies using pip:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install -r requirements.txt

Modules
--------

### Bank Account Module

The Bank Account module consists of three classes: `BankAccount`, `CheckingAccount`, and `SavingsAccount`. The `BankAccount` class is the base class that represents a general bank account. It has an initializer method `__init__` that takes an account number and an initial balance as parameters. It also has methods to deposit and withdraw money, as well as to get the current balance.

The `CheckingAccount` class is a subclass of `BankAccount` that represents a checking account. It has an additional method `deduct_fee` that deducts a fee from the account balance.

The `SavingsAccount` class is also a subclass of `BankAccount` that represents a savings account. It has an additional method `add_interest` that adds interest to the account balance.

### Calculator Module

The Calculator module provides a simple calculator program that performs basic arithmetic operations. It defines four functions: `add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, and `divide`. These functions take two float numbers as input and perform the respective arithmetic operation.

The `calculator` function displays a menu for the user to choose an arithmetic operation. The user is prompted to enter their choice, and then enter two numbers for the operation.

### Double Function Module

The Double Function module defines a simple function called `double` that takes an integer as input and returns its double. This function is designed to simply multiply the input number by 2.

### String Manipulation Module

The String Manipulation module defines a function called `add_string_to_name` that takes a string as input and returns a new string with '_name' appended to the end. This function can be used to modify file names or any other string by adding a specific suffix.
