LLM GitHub Actions
=====================

.. important::

    This document is a generated description of the provided code snippets.
    It is not an actual README file.

Project Description
==================

The LLM GitHub Actions project consists of three main parts:

1. A simple function named `double` that takes an integer as input and returns its double.
2. A function named `add_string_to_name` that takes a string as input and returns a new string with '_name' appended to the end.
3. A script that provides a simple command-line calculator for basic arithmetic operations, with error handling for non-numeric input and division by zero.

The project demonstrates various aspects of Python programming, including functions, input/output, error handling, and command-line interfaces.

Installation Instructions
=========================

To install the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   .. code-block:: bash

      git clone https://github.com/<username>/llm_github_actions.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   .. code-block:: bash

      cd llm_github_actions

3. Install the required dependencies (if any) by running:

   .. code-block:: bash

      pip install -r requirements.txt

File Descriptions
================

- `double.py`: Contains the `double` function, which takes an integer as input and returns its double.
- `add_string_to_name.py`: Contains the `add_string_to_name` function, which takes a string as input and returns a new string with '_name' appended to the end.
- `school_calculator.py`: Contains the `school_calculator` script, which provides a simple command-line calculator for basic arithmetic operations.

Usage
=====

To use the project, follow these steps:

1. Run the `double.py` script to see the double of a given integer:

   .. code-block:: bash

      python double.py

2. Run the `add_string_to_name.py` script to append '_name' to a given string:

   .. code-block:: bash

      python add_string_to_name.py "Hello World"
