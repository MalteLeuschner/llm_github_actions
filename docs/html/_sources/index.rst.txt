Banking System and Calculator

**Project Description**
=====================

The Banking System and Calculator project is a comprehensive Python application that provides a banking system with various account types and a calculator for simple arithmetic operations.

The banking system consists of three classes: `BankAccount`, `CheckingAccount`, and `SavingsAccount`. These classes provide methods for depositing and withdrawing money, deducting fees, and adding interest. The program demonstrates the usage of these classes by creating instances of `CheckingAccount` and `SavingsAccount` and performing various operations.

The calculator module provides four arithmetic functions: `add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, and `divide`. These functions take two float numbers as input and perform the respective arithmetic operation. The `calculator` function displays a menu for the user to choose an arithmetic operation and performs the chosen operation.

**Installation Instructions**
==========================

To install the Banking System and Calculator project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository using `git clone <repository_url>`
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the script using `python main.py`

**Directory Structure**
=====================

The project directory structure is as follows:

* `banking_system/`
	+ `__init__.py`
	+ `bank_account.py`
	+ `checking_account.py`
	+ `savings_account.py`
* `calculator/`
	+ `__init__.py`
	+ `calculator.py`
* `main.py`

**File Descriptions**
=====================

### banking_system/bank_account.py

This file contains the `BankAccount` class, which is the base class for the banking system. It provides methods for depositing and withdrawing money, as well as getting the current balance.

### banking_system/checking_account.py

This file contains the `CheckingAccount` class, which is a subclass of `BankAccount`. It provides an additional method `deduct_fee` that deducts a fee from the account balance.

### banking_system/savings_account.py

This file contains the `SavingsAccount` class, which is a subclass of `BankAccount`. It provides an additional method `add_interest` that adds interest to the account balance.

### calculator/calculator.py

This file contains the `calculator` function, which displays a menu for the user to choose an arithmetic operation and performs the chosen operation.

### main.py

This file contains the main entry point of the script, which calls the `calculator` function and demonstrates the usage of the banking system classes.

**Usage**
=====

To use the Banking System and Calculator project, simply run the `main.py` script. The script will display a menu for the user to choose an arithmetic operation or demonstrate the usage of the banking system classes.
