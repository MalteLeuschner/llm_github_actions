=====================

Introduction
============

The llm\_github\_actions project is a powerful tool that provides a streamlined approach to managing GitHub Actions for Python projects. It offers a centralized location for defining and managing workflows, making it easier to maintain and update your GitHub Actions.

Installation
============

To install the llm\_github\_actions project, you can use pip, the Python package installer. First, ensure that you have Python 3.6 or higher installed on your system. Then, run the following command in your terminal:

.. code:: bash

    pip install llm_github_actions

Dependencies
============

The llm\_github\_actions project relies on the following dependencies:

- GitHub Actions
- Python 3.6 or higher

Module Descriptions
===================

The following modules are included in the llm\_github\_actions project:

- `car.py`: This module defines a `Car` class with attributes `make` and `speed`. It includes methods `accelerate()` and `brake()` for changing the speed of the car.
- `display_speed.py`: This module includes a `display_speed()` function that takes a `Car` object as an argument and prints its current speed.

Usage
=====

To use the llm\_github\_actions project, you can create a `Car` object and manipulate its speed using the `accelerate()` and `brake()` methods. After each speed change, you can print the current speed using the `display_speed()` function.

Here's an example:

.. code:: python

    from car import Car
    from display_speed import display_speed

    my_car = Car(make="Tesla", speed=0)
    display_speed(my_car)

    my_car.accelerate(10)
    display_speed(my_car)

    my_car.accelerate(10)
    display_speed(my_car)

    my_car.accelerate(10)
    display_speed(my_car)

    my_car.brake(5)
    display_speed(my_car)

    my_car.brake(5)
    display_speed(my_car)

Sure, I'd be happy to help you understand the following Python code. Here's a description of the classes and functions, as well as an explanation of how they fit into the program's flow:

The code defines a class `Car` with two attributes: `make` and `speed`. It also includes a method `accelerate()` that increases the speed of the car by a given amount, and a method `brake()` that decreases the speed of the car by a given amount.

Additionally, there is a function `display_speed()` that takes a `Car` object as an argument and prints its current speed.

The program begins by creating an instance of the `Car` class with a make of "Tesla" and an initial speed of 0. It then calls the `accelerate()` method three times, increasing the speed by 10 each time. After each acceleration, the `display_speed()` function is called to print the current speed.

Next, the `brake()` method is called twice, decreasing the speed by 5 each time. Again, the `display_speed()` function is called after each brake to print the current speed.

Here's a summary of the classes and functions in the code:

* `Car`: A class representing a car with attributes `make` and `speed`. It includes methods `accelerate()` and `brake()` for changing the car's speed.
* `display_speed()`: A function that takes a `Car` object as an argument and prints its current speed.

The program flow is as follows:

1. Create a `Car` object with a make of "Tesla" and an initial speed of 0.
2. Call the `accelerate()` method three times, increasing the speed by 10 each time. After each acceleration, print the current speed.
3. Call the `brake()` method twice, decreasing the speed by 5 each time. After each brake, print the current speed.

The provided code contains a single function named `double` which takes an integer as an input and returns its double. The function does not contain any exceptions and has no class association.

The `double` function is called in the main section of the script with the input value of 5, and the result is printed to the console.

Here's a description of the `double` function:

`double(number: int) -> int`: Returns the double of the input number.

This function doubles the input number.

Args:
number (int): The number to be doubled.

Returns:
int: The double of the input number.

Raises:
None.

In the main section of the script, the `double` function is called with the input value of 5, and the result is printed to the console.

The program flow is as follows:

1. The `double` function is defined with a single input parameter `number` of type integer.
2. The function returns the result of multiplying the input number by 2.
3. In the main section of the script, the `double` function is called with the input value of 5.
4. The result of the function call is printed to the console.

The provided code contains a single function `add_string_to_name` and a main section that calls this function.

The `add_string_to_name` function takes an input string `test` as an argument and returns a new string with '_name' appended to the end.

In the main section, the function `main` is called with the argument "Hello Wo23rld23asd323423242122". However, the function `main` is not defined in the provided code. It can be assumed that this function is defined elsewhere and takes care of executing the main program logic.

The output of the `main` function call is not displayed in the provided code. It can be assumed that the output is handled by the `main` function or displayed in the console.

In summary, the `add_string_to_name` function takes a string as input and returns a new string with '_name' appended to the end. The main section of the code calls this function with a specific argument.

The script consists of five functions and one main function called `school_calculator`.

The first function, `add(x: float, y: float) -> float`, takes two float numbers as input and returns their sum.

The second function, `subtract(x: float, y: float) -> float`, subtracts the second number from the first number and returns the result.

The third function, `multiply(x: float, y: float) -> float`, takes two float numbers as input and returns their product.

The fourth function, `divide(x: float, y: float) -> Union[float, str]`, divides the first number by the second number. If the second number is not zero, it returns the result of the division. Otherwise, it returns an error message.

The fifth function, `school_calculator() -> None`, provides a simple calculator interface to perform basic arithmetic operations. It prints a menu to select an operation and takes user input for the operation, first number, and second number. It then calls the appropriate function based on the user's selection and prints the result. If the input values are not numeric, it raises a ValueError.

The main function calls the `school_calculator()` function.

The script does not contain any classes.
