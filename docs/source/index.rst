**{project_name}**
=====================

**Project Description**
---------------------

The {project_name} project is a collection of Python scripts that demonstrate various programming concepts and principles. The project consists of four scripts, each showcasing a different aspect of Python programming.

The first script demonstrates object-oriented programming principles, including inheritance and polymorphism, to model different types of bank accounts and their behaviors. The second script provides a simple calculator program that performs basic arithmetic operations. The third script is a simple Python script that returns a string value when run directly. The fourth script demonstrates string manipulation by appending a suffix to an input string.

**Installation Instructions**
-----------------------------

To install the {project_name} project, simply clone the repository and navigate to the project directory. The project has no dependencies, and all scripts can be run directly using Python.

**Directory Structure**
---------------------

The project directory contains four Python scripts:

* `bank_accounts.py`
* `calculator.py`
* `main.py`
* `string_manipulation.py`

**File Descriptions**
-------------------

### bank_accounts.py

This script consists of three classes: `BankAccount`, `CheckingAccount`, and `SavingsAccount`. The `BankAccount` class is the base class that represents a general bank account. The `CheckingAccount` class is a subclass of `BankAccount` that represents a checking account, and the `SavingsAccount` class is also a subclass of `BankAccount` that represents a savings account.

### calculator.py

This script provides a simple calculator program that performs basic arithmetic operations. It defines four functions: `add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, and `divide`, and a `calculator` function that displays a menu for the user to choose an arithmetic operation.

### main.py

This script consists of a single function `main()` and a conditional statement to execute the `main()` function when the script is run directly. The `main()` function returns a string value 'test2233'.

### string_manipulation.py

This script consists of a single function `main` that takes a string as input and returns a modified string with the suffix "_hahahaha" appended to it.

**Usage**
---------

To use the {project_name} project, simply run each script individually using Python. For example, to run the `bank_accounts.py` script, navigate to the project directory and run `python bank_accounts.py`.
