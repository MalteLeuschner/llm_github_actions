LLM GitHub Actions
=====================

Project Description
-------------------

The LLM GitHub Actions project is a collection of Python scripts that demonstrate the use of GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment. The project includes three main scripts, each showcasing a different aspect of GitHub Actions.

The first script, named `double.py`, contains a single function named `double` which takes an integer as an input and returns its double. The function does not contain any exceptions and has no class association. The `double` function is called in the main section of the script with the input value of 5, and the result is printed to the console.

The second script, named `add_string_to_name.py`, contains a single function `add_string_to_name` and a main section that calls this function. The `add_string_to_name` function takes an input string `test` as an argument and returns a new string with '_name' appended to the end. In the main section, the function `main` is called with a specific argument, but it is assumed that this function is defined elsewhere and takes care of executing the main program logic.

The third script, named `school_calculator.py`, consists of five functions and one main function called `school_calculator`. The first four functions perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The fifth function, `school_calculator()`, provides a simple calculator interface to perform these operations. The main function calls the `school_calculator()` function.

Installation Instructions
--------------------------

To install the project, clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/username/llm_github_actions.git

The project requires Python 3.x to run. To check the Python version, use the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   python --version

If Python 3.x is not installed, download and install it from `<https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_.

The project has no external dependencies.

File Descriptions
-----------------

- `double.py`: contains a single function named `double` which takes an integer as an input and returns its double.
- `add_string_to_name.py`: contains a single function `add_string_to_name` and a main section that calls this function.
- `school_calculator.py`: consists of five functions and one main function called `school_calculator`.

Usage
-----

To use the project, navigate to the project directory and run the desired script using the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   python <script_name>.py

For example, to run the `double.py` script, use the following command:

LLM GitHub Actions
=====================

.. important::

    This document is a generated description of the provided code snippets.
    It is not an actual README file.

Project Description
==================

The LLM GitHub Actions project consists of three main parts:

1. A simple function named `double` that takes an integer as input and returns its double.
2. A function named `add_string_to_name` that takes a string as input and returns a new string with '_name' appended to the end.
3. A script that provides a simple command-line calculator for basic arithmetic operations, with error handling for non-numeric input and division by zero.

The project demonstrates various aspects of Python programming, including functions, input/output, error handling, and command-line interfaces.

Installation Instructions
=========================

To install the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   .. code-block:: bash

      git clone https://github.com/<username>/llm_github_actions.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   .. code-block:: bash

      cd llm_github_actions

3. Install the required dependencies (if any) by running:

   .. code-block:: bash

      pip install -r requirements.txt

File Descriptions
================

- `double.py`: Contains the `double` function, which takes an integer as input and returns its double.
- `add_string_to_name.py`: Contains the `add_string_to_name` function, which takes a string as input and returns a new string with '_name' appended to the end.
- `school_calculator.py`: Contains the `school_calculator` script, which provides a simple command-line calculator for basic arithmetic operations.

Usage
=====

To use the project, follow these steps:

1. Run the `double.py` script to see the double of a given integer:

   .. code-block:: bash

      python double.py

2. Run the `add_string_to_name.py` script to append '_name' to a given string:

   .. code-block:: bash

      python add_string_to_name.py "Hello World"

3. Run the `school_calculator.py` script to use the command-line calculator:

   .. code-block:: bash

      python school_calculator.py
