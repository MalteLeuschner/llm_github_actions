llm_github_actions
=====================

Welcome to llm_github_actions, a comprehensive Python project that demonstrates various concepts and techniques in Python programming.

Project Description
-----------------

llm_github_actions is a collection of Python scripts that showcase different aspects of Python programming, including object-oriented programming, function definitions, and arithmetic operations. The project consists of four modules, each with its own unique functionality and purpose.

Installation Instructions
------------------------

To install llm_github_actions, simply clone the repository and install the required dependencies using pip:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install -r requirements.txt

This will install all the necessary dependencies required to run the project.

Modules
--------

### Bank Account Module

The Bank Account module consists of three classes: `BankAccount`, `CheckingAccount`, and `SavingsAccount`. The `BankAccount` class is the base class that represents a general bank account, while `CheckingAccount` and `SavingsAccount` are subclasses that represent specific types of bank accounts.

### Double Function Module

The Double Function module defines a single function `double` that takes an integer as input and returns its double.

### Add String to Name Module

The Add String to Name module consists of a single function `add_string_to_name` that takes a string as input and returns a new string with '_name' appended to the end.

### Calculator Module

The Calculator module defines five functions: `add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, and `divide`, which perform basic arithmetic operations. The `calculator` function displays a menu for simple arithmetic operations and performs the chosen operation.

Usage
-----

To use llm_github_actions, simply run the scripts directly or import the modules as needed. For example, to use the Bank Account module, create instances of `CheckingAccount` and `SavingsAccount` and call their methods to deposit and withdraw money, deduct fees, and add interest.
