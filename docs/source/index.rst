Project Description
-------------------

The LLM GitHub Actions project is a collection of Python scripts that provide various functionalities. The project contains three main scripts:

1. A script that contains a single function named `double` which takes an integer as an input and returns its double.
2. A script that contains a single function `add_string_to_name` that takes an input string `test` as an argument and returns a new string with '_name' appended to the end.
3. A script that consists of five functions and one main function called `school_calculator`. The functions provide a simple calculator interface to perform basic arithmetic operations.

Installation Instructions
-------------------------

To install the project, clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/llm_github_actions.git
```
The project requires Python 3.x to run. To check the Python version, use the following command:
```bash
python --version
```
The project has no external dependencies.

File Descriptions
-----------------

- `double.py`: Contains a single function named `double` which takes an integer as an input and returns its double.
- `add_string_to_name.py`: Contains a single function `add_string_to_name` that takes an input string `test` as an argument and returns a new string with '_name' appended to the end.
- `school_calculator.py`: Consists of five functions and one main function called `school_calculator`. The functions provide a simple calculator interface to perform basic arithmetic operations.

Usage
-----

To use the `double` function, run the following command:
```bash
python double.py
```
The output will be the double of the input number, which is 10 in this case.

To use the `add_string_to_name` function, run the following command:
```bash
python add_string_to_name.py "Hello World"
```
The output will be a new string with '_name' appended to the end, which is "Hello World_name" in this case.

To use the `school_calculator` script, run the following command:
```bash
python school_calculator.py
```
The script will print a menu to select an operation and take user input for the operation, first number, and second number. Based on the user's selection, it calls the appropriate function to perform the operation and prints the result. It continues to take user input for new calculations until the user decides to stop.

Project Description
-------------------

The LLM GitHub Actions project is a collection of Python scripts that perform various arithmetic operations. It includes three main scripts, each with its unique functionality. The first script contains a single function named `double` that takes an integer as input and returns its double. The second script contains a function `add_string_to_name` that takes an input string and returns a new string with '_name' appended to the end. The third script consists of five functions that perform basic arithmetic operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The project's main function, `school_calculator`, provides a simple calculator interface to perform these arithmetic operations.

Installation Instructions
-------------------------

To install the project, clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/username/llm_github_actions.git

The project requires Python 3.x to run. To check the Python version, use the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   python --version

If you don't have Python installed, download and install it from the official website: <https://www.python.org/downloads/>

The project has no external dependencies.

File Descriptions
-----------------

The project contains the following files:

* `double.py`: A script that contains a single function named `double` that takes an integer as input and returns its double.
* `add_string_to_name.py`: A script that contains a function `add_string_to_name` that takes an input string and returns a new string with '_name' appended to the end.
* `school_calculator.py`: A script that contains five functions that perform basic arithmetic operations and a main function `school_calculator` that provides a simple calculator interface to perform these arithmetic operations.

Usage
-----

To use the `double` function, run the `double.py` script with the input value:

.. code-block:: bash

   python double.py 5

The output will be:

.. code-block:: bash

   10

To use the `add_string_to_name` function, run the `add_string_to_name.py` script with the input string:

.. code-block:: bash

   python add_string_to_name.py "Hello World"

The output will be:

.. code-block:: bash

   Hello World_name

To use the `school_calculator` function, run the `school_calculator.py` script:

.. code-block:: bash

   python school_calculator.py

The script will prompt you to select an operation and enter two numbers to perform the corresponding arithmetic operation.

Project Description
-------------------

The LLM GitHub Actions project is a collection of Python scripts that perform various calculations and string manipulations. The project consists of three main scripts, each with its unique functionality.

The first script contains a single function named `double` which takes an integer as an input and returns its double. The function does not contain any exceptions and has no class association.

The second script contains a single function `add_string_to_name` that takes an input string `test` as an argument and returns a new string with '_name' appended to the end.

The third script consists of five functions and one main function called `school_calculator`. The functions include `add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, `divide`, and `school_calculator`. The `school_calculator` function provides a simple calculator interface to perform basic arithmetic operations.

Installation Instructions
-------------------------

To install the project, clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/username/llm_github_actions.git

The project requires Python 3.x to run. To check the Python version, use the following command:

The `school_calculator` function provides a simple calculator interface to perform basic arithmetic operations.

Usage
-----

To use the `double` function, run the `double.py` script with the input value. For example, to double the number 5, run the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   python double.py 5

The output will be 10.

To use the `add_string_to_name` function, run the `add_string_to_name.py` script with the input string. For example, to append '_name' to the string "Hello World", run the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   python add_string_to_name.py "Hello World"

The output will be "Hello World_name".

To use the `school_calculator` function, run the `school_calculator.py` script and follow the prompts to enter the operation, first number, and second number. The script will then call the appropriate function based on the user's selection and print the result.
