**{project_name}**
=====================

**Project Description**
---------------------

The {project_name} project is a collection of Python scripts that demonstrate various concepts and techniques in Python programming. The project consists of four scripts, each with its own unique functionality and purpose.

The first script demonstrates object-oriented programming by implementing a banking system with three classes: `BankAccount`, `CheckingAccount`, and `SavingsAccount`. The second script provides a simple calculator function that performs arithmetic operations. The third script is a simple Python script that returns a string value when run directly. The fourth script demonstrates string manipulation by appending a suffix to an input string.

To install the {project_name} project, simply clone the repository and navigate to the project directory. The project does not require any additional dependencies or installations.

**Directory Structure**
---------------------

The project directory contains four Python scripts: `banking_system.py`, `calculator.py`, `main.py`, and `string_manipulation.py`. Each script is a standalone program that can be run independently.
