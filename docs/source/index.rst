Project Title: Car and ElectricCar Classes
====================================

Project Description
-------------------

This project defines two classes, `Car` and `ElectricCar`, to represent regular cars and electric cars, respectively. The `ElectricCar` class inherits from the `Car` class and has an additional attribute and method to represent the battery size and charging functionality.

Installation Instructions
------------------------

To install this project, simply download the source code and include it in your Python project. There are no external dependencies required.

Verzeichnisstruktur
-------------------

The project has the following directory structure:

* index.rst (this file)
* car.py (Python source code)

Dateibeschreibungen
------------------

* car.py:

  * `Car` class:

    * `make` attribute: A string representing the make of the car.
    * `model` attribute: A string representing the model of the car.
    * `start_engine()` method: A method that prints a message indicating that the engine has started.

  * `ElectricCar` class:

    * Inherits from the `Car` class.
    * `battery_size` attribute: An integer representing the size of the battery in the electric car.
    * `charge_battery()` method: A method that takes a charge level as an argument and sets the battery level to that value.

  * `create_car()` function: A function that takes a make and model as arguments and returns an instance of the `Car` class with those attributes.

  * `create_electric_car()` function: A function that takes a make, model, and battery size as arguments and returns an instance of the `ElectricCar` class with those attributes.

  * `main()` function: The entry point of the program. It creates an instance of the `Car` class and an instance of the `ElectricCar` class, and then calls the `start_engine()` method on each of them. It also calls the `charge_battery()` method on the `ElectricCar` instance.

Nutzung
-------

To use this project, simply import the `Car` and `ElectricCar` classes from the `car` module and create instances of each class. You can then call the `start_engine()` method on both instances and the `charge_battery()` method on the `ElectricCar` instance.
