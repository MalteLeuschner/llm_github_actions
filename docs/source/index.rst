LLM GitHub Actions
=====================

Project Description
-------------------

The LLM GitHub Actions project is a collection of Python scripts that demonstrate the use of GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment. The project includes three main scripts, each showcasing a different aspect of GitHub Actions.

The first script, named `double.py`, contains a single function named `double` which takes an integer as an input and returns its double. The function does not contain any exceptions and has no class association. The `double` function is called in the main section of the script with the input value of 5, and the result is printed to the console.

The second script, named `add_string_to_name.py`, contains a single function `add_string_to_name` and a main section that calls this function. The `add_string_to_name` function takes an input string `test` as an argument and returns a new string with '_name' appended to the end. In the main section, the function `main` is called with a specific argument, but it is assumed that this function is defined elsewhere and takes care of executing the main program logic.

The third script, named `school_calculator.py`, consists of five functions and one main function called `school_calculator`. The first four functions perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The fifth function, `school_calculator()`, provides a simple calculator interface to perform these operations. The main function calls the `school_calculator()` function.
